    Thursday, July 2, 2015, 6 p.m.

  * **Where?**  
    [yelster digital gmbh][1]  
    [Jakob-Haringer-Straße 8, 5020 Salzburg][2]

  * **What?**  
    a joint effort to solve a [coding dojo][3], employing test-driven
    development and pair programming

To help us with planning, please RSVP on
[this Stammtisch’s Meetup.com page][4] if you are going to join us.  After the
dojo, you are invited to present a topic of your choice; please reply when
RSVP’ing if you would like to a give a short talk.

*The usual disclaimer applies:*

  * *If you would like to attend but cannot make it at six o’clock, please let
    us know in the comments at least 72 hours in advance.  As we do not fancy
    losing guests over such mundane problems, we might postpone the event in
    this case, and kick off the meetup at seven.*

  * *If there are less than five confirmed participants to this meetup
    24 hours prior to the event, we reserve to change the agenda or cancel the
    Stammtisch entirely.*

  * *In case of high participation interest, the meetup will be held at
    the [Techno-Z Veranstaltungszentrum][5].*
