In our ninth “Stammtisch” (regulars’ table), we will examine what the Easter
Bunny has left for us.

  * **When?**  
    Thursday, April 16, 2015, 6 p.m.

  * **Where?**  
    [yelster digital gmbh][1]  
    [Jakob-Haringer-Straße 8, 5020 Salzburg][2]

  * **What?**  
    a hands-on introduction to [Flask][3]’s [FlatPages extension][4]

For easier planning, please RSVP on [this Stammtisch’s Meetup.com page][5] if
you intend to participate.  Suggestions for other topics are welcome, too—just
reply when RSVP’ing.  You are also invited to present something on a subject
matter of your choice, be it as comprehensive or concise as you want.

*Note I: If you would like to attend but cannot make it at six o’clock, please
let us know at least 72 hours in advance.  As we do not fancy losing guests
over such mundane problems, we might postpone the event in this case, and kick
off the meetup at seven.*

*Note II: If there are less than five confirmed participants to this meetup
24 hours prior to the event, we reserve to change the agenda or cancel the
Stammtisch entirely.*

*Note III: In case of high participation interest, the meetup will be held at
the [Techno-Z Veranstaltungszentrum][6].*

### Roundup

Due to last-minute cancellations, we only welcomed two guests this time, but
this was in no way detrimental to the atmosphere.  In the end, the live coding
presentation resulted in a brand-new SalzPUG website; the source code is
[freely available on GitHub][7].
