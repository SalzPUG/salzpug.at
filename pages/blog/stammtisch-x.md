We are finally going double digits—at least if you are used to Arabic
numerals.

  * **When?**  
    Thursday, May 21, 2015, 6 p.m.

  * **Where?**  
    [yelster digital gmbh][1]  
    [Jakob-Haringer-Straße 8, 5020 Salzburg][2]

  * **What?**  
    a presentation on [Docker][3], the latest greatest thing since sliced
    bread for virtualization

For easier planning, please RSVP on [this Stammtisch’s Meetup.com page][4] if
you intend to join us.  As always, we will warmly welcome suggestions for
other topics, too—please reply when RSVP’ing.  You are also invited to present
something on a subject matter of your choice, be it as comprehensive or
concise as you want.

*Note I: If you would like to attend but cannot make it at six o’clock, please
let us know in the comments at least 72 hours in advance.  As we do not fancy
losing guests over such mundane problems, we might postpone the event in this
case, and kick off the meetup at seven.*

*Note II: If there are less than five confirmed participants to this meetup
24 hours prior to the event, we reserve to change the agenda or cancel the
Stammtisch entirely.*

*Note III: In case of high participation interest, the meetup will be held at
the [Techno-Z Veranstaltungszentrum][5].*
