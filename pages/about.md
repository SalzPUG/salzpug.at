title: About

We are a crop of people who have a soft spot for the [Python][1] programming
language, centered around the city of Salzburg.

We aim to meet on a regular monthly basis, to discuss and/or present
Python-relevant topics, and, at times, collaboratively hack on
[coding dojos][2]â€”i.e., small programming exercises.  Our meetings are based
at the [Techno-Z Veranstaltungszentrum][3], and we warmly welcome anyone who
would like to join or visit.

We invite you to join our [group at Meetup.com][4] to stay informed about
upcoming meetings.  Head over to our [GitHub account][5] if you want to admire
the outcomes of our programming exercises.
